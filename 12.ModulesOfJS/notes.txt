If we have a lengthier code, we need to modularize our code to make it easier and understandable.
In this scenario modules are used.

1.What are modules?
  1.Modules are self-contained units of code that encapsulate functionality.
  2.Allows to break the code into logical pieces.
  3.Makes the application easier to understand,test and maintain.

  Currently, in JavaScript the modules are implemented using ES6 modules which was introduced in 2015.
  Before that IIFE was used to modularize the code.
  Common JS tools ,but they are not supported by web.. they are only used in Nodejs(backend-require,exports)

2.IIFE module pattern
  IIFE is solving only one problem i.e. the global scope is not being cluttered.
ordering can still be a problem in iife.. in order to ensure that ordering should not be a problem we can actually use ES6 modules.

 You can import multiple functions and variables in named import or export..
 But in case of default import/export only one item can be imorted in each module
