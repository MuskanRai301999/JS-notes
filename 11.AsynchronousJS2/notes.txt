Promise is nothing but an object.It's like a container which stores the future value.
So it creates the future values to be stored in it.

Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript.
A Promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function,which represents the current state of the operation.
At the time the Promise is returned to the caller, the operation often isn't finished,but the promise provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the operation.
