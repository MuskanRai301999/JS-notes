1.let sum=0;
for(let i=0;i<=10;i+=2){
    sum +=i;
}
console.log(sum);
ans=30 2+4+6+8+10

2.In which scenario you will be more likely to use a while loop
 when the value of a variable is uncertain or unknown after each operation
 when iterating over data with an unknown length

3.If the condition is true for n iterations, then how many times will different loops run?
   Do-while: n+1
While & for loop: n

For a do..while loop the code block will run at least once regardless of the condition and will continue to run as long as the condition remains true after each iterations
this menas that if a condition is true for n iterations the block will run n+1 times 
once before the condition is checked
and then n times as long as the condition remains true

4.What among the following would be the best case for default parameter?
  Creating function for generating password with default length 8
  Creating a function yo calculate the area of a rectangle , where the default value for the length and breadth is set to 1
  Creating a function to create new user id with default parameters

5. If the default parameter value is not specified for a parameter,the parameter will be assigned the value undefined as its default parameter

6.What is the purpose of the return statement in a function in JavaScript?
  To terminate the function
  To specify the output of the function

7.function getValue(){
    return 1, 2, 3;
}
var result =getValue();
console.log(result);
ans=3
When you use commas to seperate values (return 1,2,3;)
JavaScript interprets it as the comma operator 
which evaluates each expression but only returns the value of the last expression 
In this case the function is effectively returning only 3.

8.function calculate(length,breadth){
    const area = length*breadth;
}
const area =calculate(5,5);
console.log(area);
In javaScript if the return statement is not defined in a function it automatically returns undefined

9.What are the various data types that can be added to an array?
   objects
   arrays
   primitive datatypes
   functions

10.What will be the output if we add multiple values to the unshift method ?
   The elements will be added to the array in the front in the same order as given

11.var fruits =['banana','orange'];
    var newLength = fruits.push(['apple','mango']);
    console.log(newLength);
    The array passed as arguements to push will be treated as a single element and added to the fruits array.The return value of fruits.push will be the new length of the array which in this case is 3.
     
12. write the output of the code
    const arr1=[1,2,34,5];
    const arr2 =arr1.slice();
    arr2.push(6);
    console.log(arr1);
    ans=[1,2,34,5]
    If you don't pass any parameter in the slice then the default parameter will be used in place of start and end which is 0 and length of array respectively.

13.var arr=['a','b','c','d'];
   arr.splice(2,'x','y');
   console.log(arr);
   [a,b,y,c,d];
   If you don't specify the deleteCount in the splice method it will automatically take the next parameter as deleteCount , since here the next parameter is a string so it will get discarded and 'y' will be inserted at index2.

13.const arr =Array.from("CodingNinja");
console.log(arr);
['C','o','d','i',....]
The Array.from is used to  create a new array from any iterabke data.
When used with string it will create an Array with all the characters of the string

14.When checking if your name is present in the given array of users, which of the following methods would be the most suitable to use?
    includes()
    In such cases Includes would be the most suitable as it returns a boolean value indicating if the element is present in the array

15.Which loop is more suitable for iterating over arrays and performing operations by directly accessing each element without using indices?
   for..of loop

16.What happens when a break statement is encountered within a nested loop structure?
    Only the innermost loop is terminated

17.Alice has a list of student marks, and she wants to calculate the average of all the students. If a grade is marked "absent," which JavaScript keyword should she use in her loop to skip this iteration and move to the next one?
   continue

18.What is the purpose of the spread operator (...) in JavaScript?
   1.To combine multiple arrays into one array
   2.To expand an array into individual elements

  19.
